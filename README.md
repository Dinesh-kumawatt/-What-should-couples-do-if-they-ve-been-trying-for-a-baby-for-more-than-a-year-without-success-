If youâ€™ve been trying for a baby for over a year (or 6 months if woman is 35+), itâ€™s time to get a fertility check-up. At Ayuh Fertility Centre, they start with basic tests for both partners â€” not just the woman.

This includes hormone tests, ultrasound for the woman, and semen analysis for the man. Based on results, they suggest a plan â€” natural timing, IUI, or IVF.

Early action helps. Waiting too long can reduce success chances â€” especially if age is a factor.
